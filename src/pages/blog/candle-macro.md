When I purchased a new macro lens (Fujinon 80mm f/2.8 OIS R WR) just before christmas I was incredibly eager to try it out. Unfortunately, all the flowers and bugs and tiny squirmy things were hibernating for winter at the time. I had to manufacture my own small-scale scene to photograph if I was going to get some use out of this lens before spring.

I was inspired by some beautiful deep red candles my mother placed out for christmas and set about photographing them. In the below behind-the-scenes photo you can see my setup (and the christmas tree in the background).

You can see that my strobe is placed camera left in a small softbox, my camera is on a tripod, and a red wash cloth is draped behind the candle to create a rich, monochomatic scene.

The initial image is full of potential but far from pleasing to look at. The strobe is freezing the smoke particles beautifully, however they need more magnification for greater impact. Additionally, I used an aperture of f/22 which is far too narrow as the texture of the washcloth is clearly visible.

![Second attempt](/images/candle-macro/secondary.jpg)

I pushed the lens to it's maximum magnification by inching the camera forward a couple inches and opened up the aperture a bit to f/8. This threw the background out of focus and filled the frame with the whole head of the candle. The technical details were now squared away, it was just a matter of manipulating the light and the smoke to make an artistic image.

Timing the smoke trail turned out to be the hardest part of creating this image. If I blew too hard there was no smoke and if I blew too softly it would simply billow around the wick as you can see in this contact sheet. Eventually though sheer luck I managed to get the smoke to billow in an artful way.

Lighting was also challenging as balancing the light on the subject and background was difficult for such a small scene.

The final image was worth the trouble in my opinion. I love the warmth of the image and the particles frozen in time in a poetic wave. The deep red highlight on the right of the frame balances beautifully with the smoke on the left. All in all a very rewarding image making process.
