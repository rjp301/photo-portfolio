> A triptych is an artwork made up of three pieces or panels. Often used to impart narrative, create a sequence, or show different elements of the same subject matter.

I'd like to personally attest to the increased impact of separate art pieces presented as one. My first exposure to this form of art was in this video from [Nick Carver](https://youtu.be/PEJ8wWv7yQM?t=143) wherein he creates a beautiful triptych using hawk feathers and an american bison skull. I found the final piece to be much more moving than any of the single photos and endeavoured to create my own triptych one day. To that end I have succeeded!

When seeking for some wall art for our new apartment I opted to create a triptych using photos from a black sand beach flight in Iceland from this summer. There were so many incredible compositions to be seen from the air that I captured dozens of uniquely beautiful compositions, yet they all shared a common thread of course. I chose three images that stand on their own and are not too similar to one another and framed and mounted them above our couch.
